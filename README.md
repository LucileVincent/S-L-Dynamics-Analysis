Smile and Laugh Dynamics in Naturalistic Dyadic Interactions: Intensity Levels, Sequences and Roles

## Presentation 
In this repository, a database of dyadic interactions was collected and annotated. From this, we presented studies concerning the influences of smiles and laughs between speakers and listeners and S&L time sequence patterns for dyadic interaction participants. These help us to better understand the S&L dynamics in such contexts and will be used to build better models for S&L-aware behavior. The findings of this work contribute to the foundation of future S&L-aware agents.
