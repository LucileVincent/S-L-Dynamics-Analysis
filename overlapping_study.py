def overlap_percentage_A(databases_name, databases_pairs, expression_pairs, expressions_track, choice):
    '''
    This function calculates the overlap percentage between two person for each pair of files.
    The total duration is calculated by adding the duration of the overlapping segments of the first person.
    When we talk about overlapping between person A to person B, this means that we are looking at all the 
    segments of person B which overlap a segment of A and this for all the segments of the tier concerned for 
    the "A" files. When we change direction (so person B to person A), we just switched the direction of the 
    files in the overlapping function. (A and B are the pair files)
        - person A to person B: {(segmentA: (segmentB n째1), (segmentB n째N), etc),...}
        - person B to person A: {(segmentB: (segmentA n째1), (segmentA n째N), etc),...}

    Args:
        databases_name: list of databases names.
        databases_pairs: list of databases pairs names.
        expression_pairs: list of expression pairs to study. For example : [("Smiles_0", "Smiles_0"),

        expressions_track: list of expression pairs to study. For example : [("Smiles_0", "Smiles_0"),
                                                                            ("Smiles_0", "Laughs_0"),

        choice: chchoice between "A/B" or "B/A". For example : "A/B" for overlapping between person A to person B 
                or "B/A" for the opposite.
        
    Returns:
        dataframes: dictionary of dataframes containing the overlap percentage and duration for each pair of 
                    files.
